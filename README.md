# ELECTRIC-CAR-USAGE-ANALYSIS-II
## OVERVIEW
In this project, I will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars.
In an effort to do this, I need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that I will have made. The selected periods of interest are either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both.
